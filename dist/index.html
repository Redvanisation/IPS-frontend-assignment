      <h2 class="title phone-p-sides-1">1. Research Your Destination To Find The Best Photo Opportunities</h2>
      <p class="main__article--text phone-p-sides-1">
        Before your trip, I recommend researching the destination to find the most interesting photo opportunities.
      </p>
      <p class="main__article--text phone-p-sides-1">
        I always research the location I’m traveling to. I do this extensively and obsessively!
      </p>
      <p class="main__article--text phone-p-sides-1">
        It’s up to you how much research you do. But you should definitely spend a bit of time looking up some great places to take pictures.
      </p>
      <p class="main__article--text phone-p-sides-1">
        So, what kind of research can you do?
      </p>
      <p class="main__article--text phone-p-sides-1">
        First, you could search for photos that other people have taken at the locations you’re planning to visit.
      </p>
      <p class="main__article--text phone-p-sides-1">
        Search on Instagram or Google to get an idea of the kinds of photos people take there.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="title phone-p-sides-1">2. Capture Your Journey To Tell The Complete Story Of Your Travels</h2>
      <p class="main__article--text phone-p-sides-1">
        Travel photography isn’t just about photographing the destination.
      </p>
      <p class="main__article--text phone-p-sides-1">
        For a more complete photographic story, capture your journey to and from the location you’re visiting.
      </p>
      <p class="main__article--text phone-p-sides-1">
        If you’re traveling by plane, try to get a window seat where you have a view of the wing or propeller.
      </p>
      <p class="main__article--text phone-p-sides-1">
        And of course, you could capture a beautiful aerial view of clouds, mountains, or city lights as you’re flying above.
      </p>
      <p class="main__article--text phone-p-sides-1">
        Your journey will often involve several different types of transport. And they all offer great photo opportunities.
      </p>
      <p class="main__article--text phone-p-sides-1">
        Whether you’re traveling by car, taxi, bus, train, boat, or plane, try to capture some interesting photos.
